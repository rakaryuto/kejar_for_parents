# Kejar for Parents

Kejar.id is one of emerging startup that provide learning management system for highschoo/vocational school and junior highschool. The problem that i tried to tackle in this project was how to connecting the report of student's activity inside Kejar.id website (which is web-based application) with parents that aren't familiar with web-based application, so that i build Kejar for Parents in Mobile-Apps-Application whith Flutter as framework development and Firebase as database managemnet. In this project, i was eligble to be the project managemer who manage, control, plan, and evaluate with waterfall methods.
